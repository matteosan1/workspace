- WTU ASN1 Protocol Definition -
--------------------------------

The asn1 definitions are organized in different files, each one containing
the messages generated by a manager or external entity.

- train_manager.asn1
- ucs_manager.asn1
- ...

DEPENDENCIES
------------
- asn1c 0.9.26

CONVENTION
----------

Topic prefix        post-prefix                 Meaning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- /state            /nameof-sender-manager      message without any specific destination, persisted in ComBroker
- /event            /nameof-sender-manager      message without any specific destination, not persisted in ComBroker
- /request          /nameof-handler-manager     message with a specific destination (the manager able to serve it), not persisted in ComBroker

In general the following rules apply:
- Each "status" and "event" topic is defined in asn1 file of the manager that produces it.
- Each "request" topic is defined in asn1 file of the manager that handles it.


NOTE
---

All INTEGER types are not limited in range because:
- Is useless (the value check is explicitly done when necessary)
- Makes asn1_helper.h too complicated
